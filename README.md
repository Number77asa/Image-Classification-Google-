09 is a 1 of azure's auto ml
Message me for questions, I am very responsive to ML ideas, basically, this work takes feature space and accends piece-wise, fiding minimal loss change; believed to be global maximum; for the given data. loss funcitons are governed by ensemble methods. See Psuedo Auto ML script for a inhouse ensemble method. I would recommend to look at mixed models, let me know if you come up with something that reduces error consistently.

some good references see files: 
Cnn has convoluted neural network script,
Amazon file has visualizations
